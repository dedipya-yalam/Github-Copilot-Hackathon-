# Weather Forecasting Tool
## Introduction
The Weather Forecasting Tool is a simple Python program that retrieves weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project was developed as part of the Microsoft GitHub Hackathon, with the assistance of GitHub Copilotâ€”a powerful AI-powered code completion tool developed by OpenAI and GitHub.

## Features
- Fetches current weather data for a specified city.
- Displays temperature in Kelvin unit.
- Provides atmospheric pressure in hPa unit.
- Shows humidity as a percentage.
- Retrieves a brief description of the weather conditions.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `WeatherForecast.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `WeatherForecast.py` file is located.
3. Run the following command to execute the program:
4. Enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve weather information when prompted.

## Example Output
```
city_name:  Tokyo
Temperature (in kelvin unit) = 291.49
atmospheric pressure (in hPa unit) = 1010
humidity (in percentage) = 75
description = broken clouds.
```
